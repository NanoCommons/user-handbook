A knowledge resource for the nanosafety community from the data and nanoinformatics shepherds
{: .lead }

This online resource started by collecting and organising knowledge and training materials for the **two strongly interconnected areas of data management for nanosafety and nanoinformatics** but will be constantly extended to also cover areas like risk assessment, Safe-and-Sustainable-by-Design and nanofabrication directly profiting from data, tools and services.

{% include clickable_image.html image_name="StartingPage.png" image_width=890 image_height=577 image_areas=page.topics %}

The generation of knowledge, common to all these areas, can be visualised as two interlinked cycles. You can hover over the figure to access short introductions to the different aspects of the cycle. Click on any of the three general areas in the lower part of the figure to access information on that topic.

If you are
- a nano scientist (wet or dry lab), who produces and wants to access and share data and knowledge
- a data manager, curator or steward or even shepherd
- a computer geek interested in nano
- want to become one of the above

or are just interested in these areas, then this handbook is for you.

## Working together
Many different research groups and projects (small and large) have and are developing data resources, software and platforms. The NanoCommons infrastructure is meant to be even one level above these platforms to bring them together and govern harmonisation and interoperability aspects across platform / projects / country borders. The success is dependent on the underlying platforms and services and since not all information on these can and should be reproduced here, we provide [short summaries and access links to the partners' websites, platforms and networks]({{ site.baseurl }}/about-and-partner-projects/).

**If you are a fan of collaborative research and want to get involved personally or with your project in extending and strengthening this community resource, you can find contact details in the [About page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about-and-partner-projects/)**.
