# Harmonised terminology, ontologies development and semantic annotation
{: .no_toc }

Semantic annotation of data and generally of scientific output across all areas of nanosafety and nanoinformatics still requires large additional efforts to define and building the required terminologies/ontologies, to provide the support infrastructure for data input and curation but also training to foster general uptake. Many different competences (domain experts, ontology experts, software development experts,...) are needed and many tools have to be made available to support the ontology development as well as then the users willing to annotated their data, protocols and standard operation procedures, results and publications all leading to more open science and FAIRness. To help all players to understand their roles and how to communicate with each other, this area of the user handbook provides general introductions, tutorials and training materials as well as links to a collaborative research platform for terminology development.

## Guidance and tools

### For data producers and curators: annotate your data

### For domain experts: generate a harmonised terminologies including clear definitions

[EU NanoSafety Terminology Harmonizer](https://terminology-harmonizer.greendecision.eu/)
Provided by the GRACIOUS project this is a tool to work collaboratively on a collection of well defined terms to be used across the complete nanosafety community. Separate but harmonised areas exist at the moment for physicochemical characterisation, nanoinformatics and simulations, bio-nano interactions, safe-by-design, regulation and manufacturing. More areas can always be added. Everyone is welcome to contribute to these area. Besides these public areas, also project specific areas exist.
