# Ten simple actions to make NanoSafety Cluster Research Output more Findable
{: .no_toc}
A lot is written about the FAIR principles for making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (just search for FAIR “NanoSafety Cluster” in Google Scholar). But the NanoSafety Cluster (NSC) is putting these things into practice. This document describes a few solutions adopted by the NSC that can be used by any NSC project partner.

A lot is written about the FAIR principles for making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable
(just search for FAIR “NanoSafety Cluster” in Google Scholar). But the NanoSafety Cluster (NSC) is putting
these things into practice. This document describes a few solutions adopted by the NSC that can be used
by any NSC project partner. Here, we widen the focus from data to research output, as proposed by Houweling.
We can even push this all the way to make NSC projects themselves more FAIR, as described in this newsletter
in 2018. To me, this is important, as a lot of nanosafety knowledge is not easily captured in raw numbers.
The integration of data sources to support nanosafety research was identified by several initiatives.
