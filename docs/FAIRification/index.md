# FAIRification
Although the human/animal health and ecotoxicological effects, environmental fate and risk assessment of nanomaterials (NMs) are in the centre of attention of European and international scientific research, nanosafety research is still suffering from the lack of sufficient reusable and verifiable data. This is the result of data fragmentation and inaccessibility, caused by the lack of infrastructure and knowledge in some nanosafety projects to make their data FAIR or even better publicly available, the incompatibility of the chosen solutions and the lack of coordination with international activities and consortia.

To change this, training resources are collected here, which not only describe the general concepts but provide hands-on solutions for everybody to be implemented into their daily work according to their [specific roles in the data management life cycle]({{ site.baseurl }}/data-management/roles/).

**Among the benefits of FAIR and Open data are:**
1. Knowledge discovery: FAIR data in combination with semantic annotation allow data to be queried and discovered by both machines and humans, while ensuring that the queried data are similar and can be brought together for the creation of bigger datasets.
2. Data integration, harmonisation and reusability: FAIR data can be brought together and integrated in a harmonised way, thus allowing data reusability under different formats and applications.
3. Maximum data exploitation and impact: Data reusability, in combination with other similar datasets, allows maximum exploitation through the application of different analytical and modelling tools and can lead to the identification of otherwise hidden patterns and novel insights.
4. Improved research quality: FAIR data, implemented with the necessary metadata, will significantly improve data quality. The integration of similar datasets, and the subsequent increase of data information, will allow better data gap identification and will help refine data plausibility and/or the identification of outliers.
5. Discipline/field independent: FAIR data does not follow a “model fits all approach”, but is highly adaptable on the specific requirements of each field.
6. Promotion of data innovation: the effort towards a full implementation of FAIR principles  is directly related to data innovation and entrepreneurship as it implies overcoming the following common obstacles for successful development of digital services::
    1. Lack of systematic processes, coordination and collaboration.
    2. Insufficient competence and training.
    3. Lack of relevant infrastructure and tools.
    4. Problems with data access across different fields.
    5. Data is not used as a strategic resource for further exploitation and growth.
7. Positive socio-economic value: a [recent study](https://ufm.dk/en/publications/2018/filer/preliminary-analysis-introduction-of-fair-data-in-denmark_oxford-research-og-hbs.pdf) commissioned by the Danish Agency for Science and Higher Education concluded that by making FAIR 50% of all data produced in Denmark, the socio-economic net present value will be about DKK 2 billion (€268mln) over a 40-year period. This estimate is based on the most conservative calculation assumptions found in literature, while disregarding the benefits that would fall to other countries if the FAIR data concept is introduced in Denmark; nor have any benefits gained from a FAIR data collaboration with other countries been included in the calculations.

**And some data and experience why not sharing data is bad:**

[Cost of not having FAIR research data](http://publications.europa.eu/resource/cellar/d375368c-1a0a-11e9-8d04-01aa75ed71a1.0001.01/DOC_1)
Report written by PwC EU Services. Seven indicators were defined to
estimate the cost of not having FAIR research data: Time spent, cost of storage, licence
costs, research retraction, double funding, interdisciplinarity and potential economic
growth. Estimated at €10.2bn per year in Europe, the measurable cost of not having FAIR research data makes an overwhelming case in favour of the implementation of the FAIR principles.

[Preliminary analysis: Introduction of FAIR data in Denmark](https://ufm.dk/en/publications/2018/preliminary-analysis-introduction-of-fair-data-in-denmark)
The analysis to estimated the benefits and costs of implementing FAIR and examined the barriers and opportunities in implementing FAIR data at the Danish research institutions. The socio-economic net present value was estimated as approx. DKK 2 billion (~270 million €) over a 40-year period,
provided that 50 per cent of all research data in Denmark follow the FAIR principles.

[The Ethics of not releasing Data](https://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2021/10/the-ethics-of-not-releasing-data-1.html?m=1)
Egon's personal blog on the recurrent theme of lack of useful data: There are many angles here, and this blog series starts collecting information about just only one angle. The ethics of not releasing data. <br> 
And the first reaction: <br>
Ineke Malsch (14 Oct, 2021): A rather picky remark is that ethics is not the same as morals. Crudely stated, ethics is a philosophical area studying ethical issues and dilemmas, while all people have (distinct) moral convictions on how they should live and what counts as good behaviour. Cultural and religious differences influence... [&#x2192; read more](https://www.ethicschool.nl/is-the-choice-to-share-research-data-an-ethical-decision)

[FAIR cookbook by the ELIXIR communities](https://fairplus.github.io/the-fair-cookbook/content/home.html)
The FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. However, the FAIR Principles are aspirational and generic. The FAIR Cookbook guides researchers and data stewards of the Life Science domain in their FAIRification journey; and also provides policy makers and trainers with practical examples to recommend in their guidance and use in their educational material.

[GO FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/)
GO FAIR is a bottom-up, stakeholder-driven and self-governed initiative that aims to implement the FAIR data principles, making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). It offers an open and inclusive ecosystem for individuals, institutions and organisations working together through Implementation Networks (INs). The INs are active in three activity pillars: GO CHANGE, GO TRAIN and GO BUILD.

[GO FAIR Implementation Network Advanced Nano](https://www.go-fair.org/implementation-networks/overview/advancednano/)
This Implementation Network actively supports the implementation of the FAIR principles in the current nano-EHS databases, i.e. data on NM physicochemical characteristics, release and exposure, toxicity and functionality.
