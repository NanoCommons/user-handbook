## NanoXtract corona prediction model
An integrated workflow based on the NanoXtract image analysis system enables experimental groups to upload NM images, extract multiple physical properties (size, diameter, roundness etc.) by image processing and feed this information into a Corona prediction model to derive predictions about the absorption of specific proteins and to compare these with experimental data.

NanoXtract Image analysis tool integrated into the NanoCommons KB, enabling upload of TEM images of NMs and automated extraction of a range of NM image descriptors.

Results of Corona prediction for one specific NM (Amorphous SiO2 NMs with a particular coating and surface functionalisation) interacting with one specific protein (major pollen allergen Bet v 1A in this case), indicating the heatmap and providing links to the mapping and logfile.

Detailed experimental results and metadata, as recorded in the NanoCommons KB.  Note also that the links to the relevant experimental data are also provided, and to the ontology terms for the specific assays, the standard operating procedure or protocol.  Additionally, the [Nano-specific extension of the InChI (the so-called NInChI)]({{ site.baseurl }}/FAIRification/FAIRidentifiers/) as developed within NanoCommons (see Lynch et al., 2020) is also provided for the specific NM, noting that this may change as it is based on the prototype (alpha) version and is not yet an IUPAC standard.
