In the context of the EU Green Deal, the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS) aims at improving the safeguard of human health and the environment as part of an ambitious approach to tackle pollution from all sources and move towards zero-pollution for air, water and soil. A key action defined in the CSS is the development of safe and sustainable by design (SSbD) criteria for chemicals. The SSbD concept promotes a holistic approach that integrates safety, circularity and functionality of chemicals, materials, products and processes throughout their entire life cycle, minimizing their environmental footprint.

To inform the development of such a framework, a review of existing frameworks1 has been conducted and is presented in [[the] report](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC127109). The scope of the CSS SSbD definition is mainly focused on safety and environmental dimensions. [The] review broadens the perspective to social and economic dimensions. Those dimensions are then articulated into aspects, assessed via methods and indicators.

The review included also an analysis of online resources (databases, tools) that can support the process of criteria development and allow a fast and reliable extraction of information related to the safety aspect of chemicals, materials or products. [It] aims to add a few more resources to the ["Inventory of tools for safe by design implementation" compiled in Chapter 5.2 of DG RTD's mapping study]({{ site.baseurl }}/SSbD/inventories/OECD-SIA/) that refers to specific tools (e.g. software) to analyse data. [It] refers to several ready-to-use tools (mainly databases) that follow current regulatory information requirements (e.g. built mainly on REACH information requirements and data but also beyond).
