[Strategic Research and Innovation Plan for safe and sustainable Chemicals and Materials](https://ec.europa.eu/assets/rtd/srip/2022//)
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/assets/rtd/srip/2022/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/SSbD/SRIP.png" width="250" class="image--right"></a>
The current Strategic Research and Innovation Plan (SRIP) delivers on this announcement and highlights current research and innovation (R&I) areas crucial for accelerating the transition to chemicals and materials that are safe and sustainable. The aim of the SRIP is to guide R&I funders in their decisions on investments across EU, national and private funding programmes. It is an opportunity for a more transparent communication among all relevant actors on joint R&I priorities proposed by the wider community: from academia to SMEs, large-scale industry, regulators and policymakers.

[Safe and Sustainable by Design chemicals and materials: Framework for the definition of criteria and evaluation procedure for chemicals and materials](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/eb0a62f3-031b-11ed-acce-01aa75ed71a1/language-en)
This report aims at proposing such a framework, presenting the dimensions, aspects, methods, and indicators that can be used to assess chemicals and materials and how criteria can be defined in order to identify those that are SSbD.
