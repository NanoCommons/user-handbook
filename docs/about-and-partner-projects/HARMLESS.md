Advanced high aspect ratio and multicomponent materials: towards comprehensive intelligent testing and Safe-by-Design strategies
{: .lead }

In the past decade public and private researchers spent great efforts on nanosafety research. This helped to establish nanotechnology on key markets and it inspired nano-specific regulatory approaches. Still, current product designs and regulations may be outpaced by the development of next generation advanced (nano-)materials.

HARMLESS develops a novel, multifaceted Safe Innovation Approach (SIA) to Multi-Component, NanoMaterials (MCNM) and High Aspect Ratio Nanoparticles (HARNs) by integrating a toolbox of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs). To ensure that industries, including SMEs, pick up our approach, we create a user-friendly decision support system (DSS) and validate it iteratively at scale in different case studies.

[Case studies](https://www.harmless-project.eu/case-studies/)
Performing case studies allows to test, verify and improve our Safe-by-Design and Safe Innovation Approaches in different industrial sectors. Close collaboration with industry from the beginning of the project enables continuous feedback to better target our decision support system.
