#  Partner project SABYDOMA
SABYDOMA addresses developments in the safety by design (SbD) paradigm by examining four industrial case studies in detail where the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) will advance from 4 to 6.

One of the novel themes of this study is to use system control and optimisation theory including the Model Predictive Control (MPC) philosophy to bind the whole subject of SbD from laboratory innovation to the industrial production line and from decision making processes to project governance. An equally important innovative step is the building of high throughput online platforms where nanomaterial (NM) is manufactured and screened at the point of production. The screening signal controls the NM redesign and production in a feedback loop.
