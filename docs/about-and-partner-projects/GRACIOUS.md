# Partner project GRACIOUS
GRACIOUS has developed a highly innovative science-based framework that supports the assessment of risk posed by the ever increasing array of nanomaterials on the market and under development. 
{: .lead }

The framework will streamline the process for assessing their risk by logically grouping nanomaterials thereby allowing extrapolation between (read-across) nanomaterials and reducing the need to assess exposure to and toxicity on a case by case basis.
