#  Partner project WorldFAIR

In the WorldFAIR project, the Committee on Data of the International Science Council (CODATA) and the Research Data Alliance (RDA) work with a set of 11 disciplinary and cross-disciplinary case studies to advance implementation of the FAIR principles.

In particular, it will improve interoperability and reusability of digital research objects, including data. Particular attention is paid to the articulation of an interoperability framework for each case study and research domain. One of the case studies will test the pilot operationalisation of the FAIR principles within the nanomaterials community; run conference sessions and workshops with stakeholders (including the InChI-for-nano domain experts, and international ‘nano’ database managers and their users) to apply, refine, implement, improve the metrics for FAIR nanosafety datasets; and develop an inventory of FAIR nanoinformatics models and their domains of applicability, underpinning datasets and APIs to support interoperability, including guidelines to further improve the interoperability of nanoinformatics models.

## Introduction to WorldFAIR
The WorldFAIR project is a major new global collaboration between partners from thirteen countries across Africa, Australasia, Europe, and North and South America. WorldFAIR will advance implementation of the FAIR data principles, in particular those for Interoperability, by developing a cross-domain interoperability framework and recommendations for FAIR assessment in a set of eleven disciplines or cross-disciplinary research areas.

... more too come soon.

_WorldFAIR is a 2 years project funded by the European Commission within Horizon Europe (Grant Agreement 101058393; June 2022 - May 2024)._
