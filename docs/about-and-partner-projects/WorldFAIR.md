#  Partner project WorldFAIR

In the WorldFAIR project, the Committee on Data of the International Science Council (CODATA) and the Research Data Alliance (RDA) work with a set of 11 disciplinary and cross-disciplinary case studies to advance implementation of the FAIR principles.

The project aims to join up disconnected initiatives on data management, data stewardship, and FAIR data practices, within and across disciplines and internationally and to co-design and harmonise interoperability frameworks and recommendations first for each case study and research domain and finally across disciplines.

[FAIR Implementation Profiles (FIPs)](https://worldfair-project.eu/fair-implementation-profiles/)
FIPs are a methodology, developed by GO FAIR, through which a research community expresses its practices and decisions around FAIR. The approach involves a series of questions on how the community makes data and metadata FAIR and what ‘FAIR Enabling Resources’ (FERs) are used.

[Cross-Domain Interoperability Framework](https://worldfair-project.eu/cross-domain-interoperability-framework/)
The Cross-Domain Interoperability Framework (CDIF) is an emerging idea for a set of guidelines around domain-agnostic standards for supporting the implementation of interoperability and reusability of FAIR data, especially across domain- and institutional boundaries.

One of the case studies is testing the pilot operationalisation of the FAIR principles within the nanomaterials community; run conference sessions and workshops with stakeholders (including the InChI-for-nano domain experts, and international ‘nano’ database managers and their users) to apply, refine, implement, improve the metrics for FAIR nanosafety datasets; and develop an inventory of FAIR nanoinformatics models and their domains of applicability, underpinning datasets and APIs to support interoperability, including guidelines to further improve the interoperability of nanoinformatics models.
