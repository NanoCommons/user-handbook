#  Partner project ASINA
ASINA aims to implement a "Safe-and-Sustainable-by-Design" (SSbyD) management methodology, a step-wise data driven methodology based upon architecture of six sigma engineering design process. 
{: .lead }

The impact and functioning of the ASINA methodology are tested across two value chains (VCs), for the production of: antimicrobial textiles and photocatalytic air purifying systems (VC1); antiaging skin care creams and antimicrobial hand creams (VC2). The ASINA expert system (ASINA-ES) is the multiple-criteria-decision-making tool developed that analyses information by addressing all the design for x dimensions: functionality, production technologies, safety, environmental sustainability, cost effectiveness, regulatory and standardisation requirements, acquiring elements from the life-cycle exposure scenarios for the minimization or maximization of the response functions and the identification of suitable range of application.
