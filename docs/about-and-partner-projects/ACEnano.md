#  Partner project ACEnano

ACEnano introduced confidence, adaptability and clarity into nanomaterial risk assessment by developing a widely implementable and robust tiered approach to nanomaterials physicochemical characterisation that simplified and facilitated contextual (hazard or exposure) description and its transcription into a reliable nanomaterials grouping framework.

This was achieved by the creation of a “conceptual toolbox” including a tiered approach to cost efficient nanomaterials analysis that facilitates decision-making in choice of techniques and SOPs, linked to a characterisation ontology framework for grouping and risk assessment.
