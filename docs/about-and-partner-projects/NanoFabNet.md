#  Partner project NanoFabNet
The NanoFabNet Project will create a strong international hub for sustainable nanofabrication, whose structure, business model, detailed strategies and action plans are designed, agreed and carried by its international stakeholders during the Project duration, in order to yield a self-sustaining collaboration platform: the NanoFabNet Hub

The NanoFabNet Project Partners are using their long experience with establishing and growing networks and associations on the national, regional and global level to design a process that guarantees the lasting success of both the proposed NanoFabNet Secretariat and the wider NanoFabNet Hub beyond the funded duration of the NanoFabNet Project.
