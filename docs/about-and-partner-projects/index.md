# About NanoCommons
{: .no_toc}
This User Guidance Handbook is an activity of **NanoCommons**, not meaning the [NanoCommons project](https://www.nanocommons.eu), even if it started it all, but in the sense of a commons for nanomaterials following the [definition from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons):
{: .lead }

_“The commons is the cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth. These resources are held in common, not owned privately. Commons can also be understood as natural resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage for individual and collective benefit. Characteristically, this involves a variety of informal norms and values (social practice) employed for a governance mechanism. Commons can be also defined as a social practice of governing a resource not by state or market but by a community of users that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates.”_

The handbook is one resource of our commons collecting and structuring knowledge and training materials for **the two strongly interlinked areas of data management for nanomaterials and nanoinformatics**. Besides covering general concepts, guidelines and recommendations, it will show, demonstrate and train real-world solutions in the form of data sources, software and workflows integrated or linked into the NanoCommons infrastructure, where both terms are meant in a very broad sense to be able to cover as many solutions as possible from all projects working in nanosafety, nanoinformatics and neighbouring fields. All projects, from which resources are included, are listed below.

## Integrated resources
To be able to cover relevant information and knowledge to the largest possible extend without the need to replicate existing material and knowledge resources, the handbook will rely heavily on external links. This also allows that most documents can be handled by long-terms sustained exchange platforms like Zenodo or FAIR knowledge bases providing persistent identifiers to the documents or datasets. All these external links (and some internal ones) are specifically highlighted and use the following annotation with respect to the available content:

| Icon | Content type |
|:-------:|:--------|
| ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/app.png){: .icon } | Web application, software tool or other digital service |
| ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/video.png){: .icon } | Video |
| ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/slides.png){: .icon } | Slides from presentations or posters |
| <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/icons/file-text.svg">{: .icon } | Text documents like reports, papers or blog posts |
| ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/webpages.png){: .icon } | Extended material from external websites |
| <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/icons/file.svg">{: .icon } | Any other type of content |

## How comments work in the Handbook
Some of the Handbook pages allow to leave comments in order to discuss the content or to make suggestions how to improve it by providing more information to existing concepts, methods and tools (e.g. new extensions, new features, new publications) or adding new ones. Even if we would prefer to include you in the list of authors directly editing the GitHub pages, we included this to give you an easier way to give feedback.

Comments are still based on GitHub functionality. This has many advantages and especially security (privacy protection, spam prevention). However, this also means that you need to set up an [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home) to be able to post comments.

Each handbook page, which allows comments, is linked to its own GitHub issues page. Here all the comments (and not only issues) can be provided.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/about/comments1.png)

Depending on the specific setup, these comments will then be visible on the Handbook page or will just be available when users are visiting the GitHub issues page to follow the discussions. The first case looks like this:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/about/comments2.png)

You can always delete your comments yourself. However, please note that we also monitor and moderate the comments. Inappropriate ones will be removed. Additionally, we will mark comments, we have addressed in an updated version of the page with <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/about/comments3.png" width="30"/>. These will then not been shown on the Handbook pages anymore but are still available in GitHub. We hope that this will help keep them clean and focus on the still relevant discussions.
