# About NanoMaterialsCommons
This User Guiance Handbook is an activity of **NanoCommons** or better **NanoMaterialCommons**, not meaning the [NanoCommons project](https://nanocommons.eu), even if it started it all, but in the sense of a commons for nanomaterials following the [definition from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons):
{: .lead }

_“The commons is the cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth. These resources are held in common, not owned privately. Commons can also be understood as natural resources that groups of people (communities, user groups) manage for individual and collective benefit. Characteristically, this involves a variety of informal norms and values (social practice) employed for a governance mechanism. Commons can be also defined as a social practice of governing a resource not by state or market but by a community of users that self-governs the resource through institutions that it creates.”_

It is one resource of our commons collecting and structuring knowledge and training materials for **the two strongly interlinked areas of data management for nanomaterials and nanoinformatics**. Besides covering general concepts, guidelines and recommendations, it will show, demonstrate and train real-world solutions in the form of data sources, software and workflows integrated or linked into the NanoMaterialCommons infrastructure, where both terms are meant in a very broad sense to be able to cover as many solutions as possible from all projects working in nanosafety, nanoinformatics and neighbouring fields. All projects, from which resources are included, are listed below.

## Integrated resources
To be able to cover relevant information and knowledge to the largest possible extend without the need to replicate existing material and knowledge resources, the handbook will rely heavily on external links. This also allows that most documents can be handled by long-terms sustained exchange platforms like Zenodo or FAIR knowledge bases providing persistent identifiers to the documents or datasets. All these external links (and some internal ones) are specifically highlighted and use the following annotation with respect to the available content:

| Icon | Content type |
|:-------:|:--------|
| ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/app.png){: .icon } | Application |
| ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/video.png){: .icon } | Video |
| ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/slides.png){: .icon } | Slides from presentations or posters |
| <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/icons/file-text.svg">{: .icon } | Text documents like reports, papers or block posts |
| ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/webpages.png){: .icon } | Extended material from external websites |
| <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/icons/file.svg">{: .icon } | Any other type of content |
