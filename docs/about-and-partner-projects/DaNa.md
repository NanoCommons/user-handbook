#  Partner project DaNa4.0
Data on new, innovative and application-safe materials
{: .lead }

The team of the German BMBF project DaNa4.0 is addressing the question of whether new, advanced materials including nanomaterials, can be harmful to humans and the environment and how humans and the environment come into contact with these materials. DaNa4.0 is the successor project to DaNa2.0 (2013-2019) and builds on its results. The scientists in the fields of human toxicology, ecotoxicology, biology and chemistry prepare complex, toxicological issues from current materials research in an generally understandable format for non-scientists, i.e. interested consumers, journalists, politicians, NGOs, etc.

In addition, the scientific results from the projects of the current BMBF funding measure NanoCare4.0 are processed and integrated into this knowledge base. The team of experts analyses current scientific literature on human and environmental toxicology of new, advanced and application-safe materials / nanomaterials to expand the knowledge platform. The evaluation of these current research results for the DaNa knowledge base is based on a careful scientific approach using the DaNa criteria catalogue.

[Knowledge Base](https://nanopartikel.info/en/knowledge/knowledge-base/)
Which innovative advanced materials and nanomaterials are used in which applications? Do humans and/or the environment come into contact with them? What consequences does this have for people and the environment? Is there a risk?
