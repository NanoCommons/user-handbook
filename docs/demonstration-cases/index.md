# Demonstration cases of data management and nanoinformatics functionalities
A case study is a particular instance of something used or analysed in order to illustrate a thesis or principle. It is meant as an in-depth study of a particular situation, method used to narrow down a very broad field of research into a researchable topic, a guide to allow further elaboration and hypothesis creation on a subject, an exercise to facilitate different disciplines / tools to combine forces but not as a sweeping statistical survey or a complete answer to a particular question.

Many nanosafety and nanoinformatics projects are nowadays driven by such case studies concentrating on aspects relevant to the objective of these project. This page is a place, where ended and ongoing studies can be presented. Especially, the latter is important since this page is also meant to be a **recruiting platform for people interested in participating in these cases**. Please contact the [NanoCommons help desk](https://www.nanocommons.eu/contact/) if you want to be put in contact with case study leaders. 

Due to the focus of this platform, we are especially interested in case studies, which showcase and highlight 
1. the capabilities and potential of the advance data management and nanoinformatics functionality especially with respect to data quality (in terms of curation and collection) and data enrichment and
2. is based on collaborative research bringing many experts and whenever possible different projects together.

We will use the term "demonstration cases" in the following for this specific type of activities.
