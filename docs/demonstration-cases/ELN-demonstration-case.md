#  NanoCommons Demonstration Case -  Electronic Laboratory Notebooks for data collection and annotation
A collaboration between [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/logos-lnnano-rodape.png" width="80" align="middle" />](https://lnnano.cnpem.br/en/scientific-divisions-and-teams/nanotoxicology-and-nanobiotechnology/diego-stefani-teodoro-martinez/), [<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/acenano.png" width="150" align="middle" />](http://www.acenano-project.eu/) and

This case demonstrates how electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) can be used to manage complex studies and collaborative research. It will also show current challenges especially with respect to the initial high effort to set up the customised workflows, integration with other data management tools and additional requirements when using in regulatory setting.

## Background and aims

The rapid technological development and increasing experimental complexity of nanosafety studies have increased the requirements regarding the proper quality management and control of the experimental workflows and the produced results. At the same time, the 2019 EU Open Data Directive, which extended the Open Research Data policy, introduced during the Horizon 2020 (H2020) framework, requires the ability fojr non-sensitive data accessibility, interoperability and reuse as per the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data  principles (1,2).

Based on these requirements, the presence of a detailed data management plan (DMP) is a must, describing how the respective data will be captured, described, handled, stored and shared. The DMPs need to have provisions for the required metadata, so that the data they complement are sufficiently described, understandable and reusable (3). 

Traditional experimental practices are not sufficient to fulfil these requirements, especially when the study design requires that data is generated by multiple laboratories based, in many cases, in different countries. To address this modern practices regarding the data and metadata capturing need to be implemented to ensure that the data management process starts at the project onset, and is not left until towards the end of the project when a lot of valuable information will have been lost (for example due to personnel movement, harddrive failures etc.). Hence, the data and metadata capturing process needs to be modernised, digitised and, as much as possible, automated. This first demonstration case was designed to evaluate how Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELNs) can be employed to achieve this. These are software dedicated to data and metadata capturing in a structured way, but offering more flexibility than the industrially or regulatory-orientated Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). While LIMS need to be managed centrally and are very rigid with respect to any required changes (due to compliance with standards such as ISO 17025, Good Manufacturing Practice etc.), ELNs offer experimentalists the opportunity to build their own workflows, note any experimental deviations and capture their data using a structured digital environment, without the need for paper laboratory notebooks that can be misplaced or destroyed.

The aims of the demonstration case were:
1. To develop structured experimental workflows using ELNs (in our case the chosen ELN was SciNote) to capture all necessary data and metadata in an experimental setting.
2. To apply these workflows using a real-life example from an ongoing EU-funded project, involving multiple partners based in different countries.
3. To establish a list of strengths and weaknesses regarding the implementation of such practices in the field of nanosafety.

Key questions of the demonstration case:
- Can ELNs be successfully applied in nanosafety research?
- Is it easy for researchers to accept ELNs for their experimental practice?
- Can ELNs be established in everyday data management practices from individual laboratories to large projects?
- What are the current bottlenecks in ELN implementation?
