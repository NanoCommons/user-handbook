description: NanoCommons Demonstration Case - Best-practice in nanosafety study design and its documentation via visual experimental maps
description_long: This demonstration case is intended to define a way to document the study design in specific laboratories with respect to the decision making processes applied. Additionally, it will design approaches to use the study design as the basis for organising the data collection and management processes and the integration of quality assurance and control measures and their documentation.
