# CUSP Webinars
This is a list of all recordings from CUSP webinars.
{: .lead } 
There is widespread scientific evidence on the ubiquity of micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) in our environment. The tiny particles which result from the degradation of larger plastics or which are manufactured and added to products for different purposes find their way into the human body through the food we eat, the water we drink or the very air we breathe. Yet, so far, we know little about the risks they pose to human health. 

For this reason, the European Commission has decided to fund five research projects - AURORA, ImpTox, PLASTICHEAL, PlasticsFatE and POLYRISK - that together form the [European Research Cluster to Understand the Health Impacts of Micro- and NanoPlastics: CUSP](https://cusp-research.eu/). They will collaborate in gathering policy-relevant scientific data to improve the risk assessment of MNPs on human health.
