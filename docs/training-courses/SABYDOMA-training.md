20 Sep. 2021.<br>
Nanomaterials have the potential to be harmful to humans and other forms of life in ways we have not fully understood yet. To minimize this risk, SABYDOMA brings together a team of 19 international organizations with the aim of using the “Safety-by-Design” concept to minimize these risks at the earliest stages of nanomaterial production. We will establish high-throughput platforms to manufacture nanomaterials and to screen their toxicity directly at the point of production.<br>
The SABYDOMA platform will use physicochemical and biological sensor elements, with the resulting signals produced being used to control the redesign and production of safe but functional nanomaterials within a feedback loop. Our approach will also enable the manufacture of safer chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cutting down on subsequent testing. Such an important innovation will not only prevent potential hazards, but will speed up the production process, decrease manufacturing costs and minimize waste in the circular economy. This event provided interested stakeholders with the opportunity to find out about the capabilities of the ACEnano Toolbox, a set of linked online tools and resources to help stakeholders choose the optimal analytical techniques for their needs.

[SABYDOMA's pitch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGC_Ih0SSZw)
6 May 2021.<br>
Video presentation of the EU H2020 project SABYDOMA. The video was presented during the Part 1 “Delivery from science” of the NanoSafety Cluster event “The delivery/usability of S(S)bD for science, regulators and the industry”, as a satellite event of the EuroNanoForum 2021.

[2nd SSbD Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5zusw26pIo)
7 March 2024.<br>
The workshop, entitled “A stakeholder’s perspective of Safe-and-­Sustainable-by-Design – a bigger picture!”, explored what progress had been made since our initial workshop, and highlighted the past four years of research and dissemination on the SSbD approach; with contributions of stakeholders from academia (University of Birmingham), European Commission, policy makers (Cefic, ChemSec), industry (Applied Nanoparticles SL, Nanotechnologies Industry Association, TEMASOL) and relevant ongoing projects (Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC)), who discussed the current status and understanding of the SSbD approach in a very interactive Roundtable discussion.

[SABYDOMA’s 2nd Legal Workshop on S(S)bD - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsS_QX-kCd8)
22 Jun. 2023.<br>
SABYDOMA organised its 2nd Legal Workshop on Safe-by-Design (SbD), on the first day of the nanoSAFE2023 conference in Grenoble, France. While the by-design paradigm now seems to be integrated into regulatory policies, legal challenges have yet to be addressed. This workshop is the first to focus on potential liability issues (Asia/EU/US) and the global regulatory dimension of the by-design approach. With expert lawyers and scientists from different regions of the world among the speakers, the workshop covered the legal aspects of the SSbD approach in the nanotechnology sector, expanding out to “by-design” approaches relevant in other technological industries.

[From human cells to metal cells, studying the harmful effects of materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulxK8CkmTJ8)
9 May 2022.<br>
Cells are the building blocks of life. But what happens when toxic material gets inside them. Cutting edge studies at the University of Leeds has allowed researchers to create artificial cells, allowing them to test hazardous materials without testing them on humans.

[SABYDOMA - SSbD Workshop - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QRcJLRqBkU)
18 Feb. 2022.<br>
The SABYDOMA project, funded by the EU H2020 programme (grant agreement no. 862296), organised virtually its workshop – A Stakeholder’s Perspective of Safe-and-Sustainable-by-Design (SSbD) – on 18th February 2022.<br>
Different experts from Academia, Industry, EU Institutions, Standardization and Regulatory bodies, and NGOs will present their understanding and definition of SSbD. This is currently a ‘hot’ topic which will be enriched by the opinions of those from a diverse range of communities. Furthermore, policy consequences of adopting one concrete “concept” will be evaluated.

[SABYDOMA’s Inline Toxicity Screening of NanoMaterials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfF4THsgS5o)
6 May 2021.<br>
Fraunhofer IBMT explains how the SABYDOMA project develops an Inline Toxicity Screening of Nanomaterials in order to align the toxicity test procedures with the production process of nanomaterials for enabling safer manufacturing of nanomaterials.

[Development of the SABYDOMA ‘bio-membrane’ sensor and ‘mini-release accelerator’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CICme2AsBhg)
15 June 2021.<br>
University of Leeds explains the coupling of a nano-material production line to a bio-membrane screening platform to demonstrate in-line screening. The video shows how the bio-membrane sensor is being developed, how it will perform and how it is integrated into the screening platform. Furthermore, it is also shown how the coupling to continuous-flow production systems is being delivered.

[1st Legal Workshop on SbD – Session 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBTcMX6f8q0&list=UULFmLAiyIqY_iAVVnMkx5uzBw&index=20)
5 Feb. 2021.<br>
With expert lawyers and scientists from different regions of the world among the speakers, the workshop covered the legal aspects of the Safe-by-Design approach in the nanotechnology sector, expanding out to “By-Design” approaches relevant in other technological industries, such as chemical and pharma. The workshop was open to scientists, industry and commercial managers, public policy stakeholders, lawyers (in-house, in a public administration or in private practice), compliance officers, patent attorneys, trade associations and NGOs representatives and all other stakeholders having interest in the safe design of (nano)technologies.
Additional parts are available from the [SABYDOMA YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnmpAi4QMgM&list=UULFmLAiyIqY_iAVVnMkx5uzBw&index=1).
