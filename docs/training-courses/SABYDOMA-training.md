20 Sep. 2021.<br>
Nanomaterials have the potential to be harmful to humans and other forms of life in ways we have not fully understood yet. To minimize this risk, SABYDOMA brings together a team of 19 international organizations with the aim of using the “Safety-by-Design” concept to minimize these risks at the earliest stages of nanomaterial production. We will establish high-throughput platforms to manufacture nanomaterials and to screen their toxicity directly at the point of production.<br>
The SABYDOMA platform will use physicochemical and biological sensor elements, with the resulting signals produced being used to control the redesign and production of safe but functional nanomaterials within a feedback loop. Our approach will also enable the manufacture of safer chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cutting down on subsequent testing. Such an important innovation will not only prevent potential hazards, but will speed up the production process, decrease manufacturing costs and minimize waste in the circular economy. This event provided interested stakeholders with the opportunity to find out about the capabilities of the ACEnano Toolbox, a set of linked online tools and resources to help stakeholders choose the optimal analytical techniques for their needs.

[SABYDOMA's pitch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGC_Ih0SSZw)
6 May 2021.<br>
Video presentation of the EU H2020 project SABYDOMA. The video was presented during the Part 1 “Delivery from science” of the NanoSafety Cluster event “The delivery/usability of S(S)bD for science, regulators and the industry”, as a satellite event of the EuroNanoForum 2021.

[SABYDOMA - SSbD Workshop - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QRcJLRqBkU)
18 Feb. 2022.<br>
The SABYDOMA project, funded by the EU H2020 programme (grant agreement no. 862296), organised virtually its workshop – A Stakeholder’s Perspective of Safe-and-Sustainable-by-Design (SSbD) – on 18th February 2022.<br>
Different experts from Academia, Industry, EU Institutions, Standardization and Regulatory bodies, and NGOs will present their understanding and definition of SSbD. This is currently a ‘hot’ topic which will be enriched by the opinions of those from a diverse range of communities. Furthermore, policy consequences of adopting one concrete “concept” will be evaluated.

[SABYDOMA’s Inline Toxicity Screening of NanoMaterials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfF4THsgS5o)
6 May 2021.<br>
Fraunhofer IBMT explains how the SABYDOMA project develops an Inline Toxicity Screening of Nanomaterials in order to align the toxicity test procedures with the production process of nanomaterials for enabling safer manufacturing of nanomaterials.

[Development of the SABYDOMA ‘bio-membrane’ sensor and ‘mini-release accelerator’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CICme2AsBhg)
15 June 2021.<br>
University of Leeds explains the coupling of a nano-material production line to a bio-membrane screening platform to demonstrate in-line screening. The video shows how the bio-membrane sensor is being developed, how it will perform and how it is integrated into the screening platform. Furthermore, it is also shown how the coupling to continuous-flow production systems is being delivered.

[From human cells to metal cells, studying the harmful effects of materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulxK8CkmTJ8)
9 May 2022.<br>
Cells are the building blocks of life. But what happens when toxic material gets inside them. Cutting edge studies at the University of Leeds has allowed researchers to create artificial cells, allowing them to test hazardous materials without testing them on humans.
