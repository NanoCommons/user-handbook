# Complete series of training materials
Besides structuring the material by topic as done in the other sections, we list here courses and series of training materials giving an overview of nanosafety and nanoinformatics and are therefore, useful for beginners or for people looking for getting an overview of the areas. Pieces of these courses are then also linked in the sections covering the specific topic covered.
