# Complete series of training materials
In addition to structuring the material by topic, as was done in other sections, we list here courses and series of training materials that provide an overview of nanosafety and nanoinformatics useful for beginners or people looking to get an overview of the areas. Parts of these courses are then also linked in the sections that cover the specific topic.
