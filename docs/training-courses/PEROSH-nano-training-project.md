# PEROSH nanomaterials training project
 
{: .lead }
Currently, there are very limited initiatives providing training on new emerging materials and NMs, despite an increased number of guidelines on both risk assessment and management, and the inclusion of specific requirements for NMs in several EU regulations.

Therefore, the current situation suggests a need for the development of training programs, shared and recognized by OSH authorities, and tailored to the need of different research and industry actors dealing with nanomaterials, and more in general with new and emerging materials.

The PEROSH nanomaterials training project is meant to do this by addressing the following objectives:
- To review and compare EU risk management and communication approaches and training experiences in the field of occupational safety and health (OSH) in dealing with emerging risks in R&D and production of advanced materials and nanomaterials (NMs).
- To propose a PEROSH/EU relevant guidance document on harmonized training modules addressed to employers and workers involved in the sector.
