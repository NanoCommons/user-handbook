7 April 2022. In line with NanoCommons’s overall goal of embedding data management activities much earlier in the experimental process, integrating instance maps directly into the study design, protocol development and on-the-fly (meta)data recording can bring additional advantages, e.g., when presenting complex studies to others, as part of (meta)data completeness, and for reporting or retrieving specific information from one part of a study. <!--- [More info...](https://zenodo.org/record/XXXX)--->
