[Webinar on Value Chain 2 - Description and regulatory context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bppb2vG0Ty)
23 Feb. 2024<br>
This webinar has been though to provide an overview of the value chain 2 regarding the use of nanomaterials in cosmetic products. In fact different nano technologies developed through the Asina Safe-by-Design approach have been included in different cosmetic formulation. The aim of this webinar is to show a real case study focusing on the specific need of the cosmetic sector both from technical point of view and regulatory point of view.

[A digital approach to implement SSbD in manufacturing processes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WW48B9xh3c)
23 Feb. 2024<br>
Nanotechnological manufacturing processes, beyond the singularity of incorporating nanoforms, do not show any additional distinctive characteristics that differentiate them from other industrial manufacturing processes. Its safe (re) design is governed by the same principles, methodologies and best practices traditionally used in engineering for the design of safe processes, which considers safety from the design stage and integrates it into the whole life cycle of the process. This safe-by-design (SbD) approach seeks to anticipate and prevent the risks of the process as well as the potential negative impacts that could arise on human health and safety, the environment, and the industrial facility itself.
Digital technologies, such as advanced sensors, IoT, data analysis or artificial intelligence, are key technologies identified by the European Commission to achieve the green and digital transitions of European industry, and attain the new paradigm of Industry 5.0 with sustainable, resilient, and human-centred production processes. Digitalization can be applied in the (re)design of industrial processes to achieve more competitive and also safer and more sustainable manufacturing processes, fully aligned with Recommendation C (2022) 8854 establishing a European assessment framework for “Safe and Sustainable by Design” (SSbD) chemicals and materials.
