# PEROSH nanomaterials training project
 
The PEROSH nanomaterials training project is meant to provide training on nanomaterial Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) by addressing the following objectives:
- To review and compare EU risk management and communication approaches and training experiences in the field of occupational safety and health (OSH) in dealing with emerging risks in R&D and production of advanced materials and nanomaterials (NMs).
- To propose a PEROSH/EU relevant guidance document on harmonized training modules addressed to employers and workers involved in the sector.
