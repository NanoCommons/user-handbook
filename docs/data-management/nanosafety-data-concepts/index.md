# (Meta)data concepts from the many years of nanosafety research
Under the motif "Learning from the past, preparing for the future", (meta)data concepts proposed and implemented for improving harmonisation and FAIRness of nanosafety data are collected here.
{: .lead }
As a follow-up of the nanosafety metadata stewardship paper (Papadiamantis et al., 2020), existing implementations of the recommendations are presented as best-practice examples in a second publication (Exner et al., in preparation). Because of the page limitations of this paper, only high level descriptions of the implementations and the underlying concepts can be presented there. Thus, the paper is mainly meant to make you aware of all the work done already in this area and we created this Handbook page as extended supporting material with more information on the implementation. This will hopefully help to transfer the concepts to new applications and build a harmonised data management ecosystem based on profiting from combining the different approaches. The page will be continuously updated to include new approaches and approaches from other fields to stay up-to-date and extend the content of the paper.

The metadata stewardship papers and the supporting material presented on this page are collaborations of many people and we acknowledge here their contributions also to earlier versions of the papers, which unfortunately did not make it into the final versions. Even if this is only a small compensation for their work, at least the text is living on here.

The following is hopefully a complete list of all authors, who have contributed to one or more of the sections above: Anastasios G. Papadiamantis, Georgia Melagraki, Jaleesia D. Amos, Nathan Bossa, Giorgos Gakis, Costas A. Charitidis, Geert Cornelis, Anna L. Costa, Philip Doganis, Lucian Farcal,  Steffi Friedrichs, Irini Furxhi, Frederick C. Klaessig, Vladimir Lobaskin, Dieter Maier, John Rumble, Haralambos Sarimveis, Blanca Suarez-Merino, Socorro Vázquez, Mark R. Wiesner, Antreas Afantitis, Barry Hardy, Eugenia Valsmai-Jones, Andrea Haase, Claus Svendson, Lee Walker, Amaia Green Etxabe, Georgios Konstantopoulos, Nikos Nikoloudakis, Konstantinos Kotsis, Martin Himly, Beatriz Alfaro, Andreas Falk, Jan Schüürman, Frank von der Kammer,Iseult Lynch, Thomas E. Exner
