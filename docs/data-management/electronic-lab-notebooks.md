#  Documenting your work with electronic lab notebooks

Electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) help to document experimental but potential also nanoinformatics work directly in electronic form. Therefore, they from an important part of data management since they facilitate data input but also the use of additional information on the performed work as metadata accompanying the data.
