# Listing of important data resources for nanosafety and nanoinformatics

[ACEnano knowledge warehouse](./ACEnano-warehouse/)
Specializing on physico-chemical characterisation techniques, protocols and data.
{: .more-link .more-link--webpages}

[NanoCommons knowledge base and data warehouse](./NanoCommons-KB/)
One-stop shop for nanosafety data by linking in different data warehouses and also the primary home of data from different projects including NanoMile, NanoFASE and SmartNanoTox.
{: .more-link .more-link--webpages}

[Nanosafety data interface](https://search.data.enanomapper.net/)
Home of data from many projects. Currently, eNanoMapper, NANoREG and NanoReg2 are publicly available.

[CEINT NanoInformatics Knowledge Commons (NIKC)](https://ceint.duke.edu/research/nikc)
Literature curated data describing nanomaterials in terms of their intrinsic, extrinsic (system-dependent), and social (e.g. anticipated use scenarios, matrix, concentration in products) properties, system characteristics (environmental, biological, laboratory, etc.), exposure and hazard measurements, calculations, and estimates.

[Nanomaterial-biological interactions knowledgebase](http://nbi.oregonstate.edu/)
Repository for annotated data on nanomaterial characterization (purity, size, shape, charge, composition, functionalization, agglomeration state), synthesis methods, and nanomaterial-biological interactions (beneficial, benign or deleterious) defined at multiple levels of biological organization (molecular, cellular, organismal)
