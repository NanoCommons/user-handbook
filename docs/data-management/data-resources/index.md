[Health and environmental safety of nanomaterials: O Data, Where Art Thou?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.impact.2021.100378)
The purpose of this review research is to transparently and comprehensively display to the nanoscience community that datasets readily available for machine learning purposes making it convenient and more efficient for the next users such as modellers or data curators to retrieve information.

## Listing of important data / knowledge resources for nanosafety and nanoinformatics

[NanoCommons knowledge base and data warehouse](./NanoCommons-KB/)
One-stop shop for nanosafety data by linking in different data warehouses and also the primary home of data from different projects including NanoMile, NanoFASE and SmartNanoTox.
{: .more-link .more-link--webpages}

[Nanosafety data interface based on the eNanoMapper database system](https://search.data.enanomapper.net/)
Home of data from many projects. Currently, eNanoMapper, NANoREG and NanoReg2 are publicly available.

[NanoPharos database](./NanoPharos/)
NanoPharos includes computationally derived data based on simulations, characterization data and biological effects.
{: .more-link .more-link--app}

[DaNa](https://nanopartikel.info/en/)
Complex, toxicological issues from current materials research in an generally understandable format for (non-)scientists.
{: .more-link .more-link--webpages}

[ACEnano knowledge warehouse](./ACEnano-warehouse/)
Specializing on physico-chemical characterisation techniques, protocols and data.

[CEINT NanoInformatics Knowledge Commons (NIKC)](https://ceint.duke.edu/research/nikc)
Literature curated data describing nanomaterials in terms of their intrinsic, extrinsic (system-dependent), and social (e.g. anticipated use scenarios, matrix, concentration in products) properties, system characteristics (environmental, biological, laboratory, etc.), exposure and hazard measurements, calculations, and estimates.
{: .more-link .more-link--app}

[Nanomaterial-biological interactions knowledgebase](http://nbi.oregonstate.edu/)
Repository for annotated data on nanomaterial characterization (purity, size, shape, charge, composition, functionalization, agglomeration state), synthesis methods, and nanomaterial-biological interactions (beneficial, benign or deleterious) defined at multiple levels of biological organization (molecular, cellular, organismal)

[Nano Exposure and Contextual Information Database (NECID)](https://perosh.eu/repository/necid-demo-version/) 
NECID is a database that contains information on NMs occupational exposure, with a focus on defining operational settings and working procedures at a high level of context. It includes a large variety of factors s that are unique to the workplace and the measurements.

[The cancer Nanotechnology Laboratory (caNanoLab)](https://cananolab.cancer.gov/)
caNanoLab database facilitates knowledge sharing within the international biomedical nanotechnology community, which helps to advance nanotechnology.
{: .more-link .more-link--app}

[Nanoparticle Information Library (NIL)](http://nanoparticlelibrary.net/nil.html)
NIL was developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIL is a platform for sharing and searching NM attributes related to health and safety. 
{: .more-link .more-link--app}

[Nanomaterial Registry (NR)](https://nanomaterialregistry.net/Default.aspx)
NR is curated database funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It collects data on the human and environmental effects of NMs from a variety of sources, including caNanoLab, NBI, and NIL.

[NanoPharos database](https://db.nanopharos.eu/ )
NanoPharos includes computationally derived data based on simulations, characterization data and biological effects.
{: .more-link .more-link--app}

[S2NANO online database](http://www.s2nano.org)
S2NANO including experimental results related to different sources of NMs. In earlier versions of the platform, the database had been accessible to the public and data were retrievable. However, the data are no longer accessible to the public.
