	abstract = {Data sharing and reuse are crucial to enhance scientific progress and maximize return of investments in science. Although attitudes are increasingly favorable, data reuse remains difficult due to lack of infrastructures, standards, and policies. The FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles aim to provide recommendations to increase data reuse. Because of the broad interpretation of the FAIR principles, maturity indicators are necessary to determine the FAIRness of a dataset. In this work, we propose a reproducible computational workflow to assess data FAIRness in the life sciences. Our implementation follows principles and guidelines recommended by the maturity indicator authoring group and integrates concepts from the literature. In addition, we propose a FAIR balloon plot to summarize and compare dataset FAIRness. We evaluated the feasibility of our method on three real use cases where researchers looked for six datasets to answer their scientific questions. We retrieved information from repositories (ArrayExpress, Gene Expression Omnibus, eNanoMapper, caNanoLab, NanoCommons and ChEMBL), a registry of repositories, and a searchable resource (Google Dataset Search) via application program interfaces (API) wherever possible. With our analysis, we found that the six datasets met the majority of the criteria defined by the maturity indicators, and we showed areas where improvements can easily be reached. We suggest that use of standard schema for metadata and the presence of specific attributes in registries of repositories could increase FAIRness of datasets.},

	abstract = {Chemoinformatics has developed efficient ways of representing chemical structures for small molecules as simple text strings, simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) and the IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI), which are machine-readable. In particular, InChIs have been extended to encode formalized representations of mixtures and reactions, and work is ongoing to represent polymers and other macromolecules in this way. The next frontier is encoding the multi-component structures of nanomaterials (NMs) in a machine-readable format to enable linking of datasets for nanoinformatics and regulatory applications. A workshop organized by the H2020 research infrastructure NanoCommons and the nanoinformatics project NanoSolveIT analyzed issues involved in developing an InChI for NMs (NInChI). The layers needed to capture NM structures include but are not limited to: core composition (possibly multi-layered); surface topography; surface coatings or functionalization; doping with other chemicals; and representation of impurities. NM distributions (size, shape, composition, surface properties, etc.), types of chemical linkages connecting surface functionalization and coating molecules to the core, and various crystallographic forms exhibited by NMs also need to be considered. Six case studies were conducted to elucidate requirements for unambiguous description of NMs. The suggested NInChI layers are intended to stimulate further analysis that will lead to the first version of a \&ldquo;nano\&rdquo; extension to the InChI standard.},

	abstract = {The emergence of nanoinformatics as a key component of nanotechnology and nanosafety assessment for the prediction of engineered nanomaterials (NMs) properties, interactions, and hazards, and for grouping and read-across to reduce reliance on animal testing, has put the spotlight firmly on the need for access to high-quality, curated datasets. To date, the focus has been around what constitutes data quality and completeness, on the development of minimum reporting standards, and on the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data principles. However, moving from the theoretical realm to practical implementation requires human intervention, which will be facilitated by the definition of clear roles and responsibilities across the complete data lifecycle and a deeper appreciation of what metadata is, and how to capture and index it. Here, we demonstrate, using specific worked case studies, how to organise the nano-community efforts to define metadata schemas, by organising the data management cycle as a joint effort of all players (data creators, analysts, curators, managers, and customers) supervised by the newly defined role of data shepherd. We propose that once researchers understand their tasks and responsibilities, they will naturally apply the available tools. Two case studies are presented (modelling of particle agglomeration for dose metrics, and consensus for NM dissolution), along with a survey of the currently implemented metadata schema in existing nanosafety databases. We conclude by offering recommendations on the steps forward and the needed workflows for metadata capture to ensure FAIR nanosafety data.},

	abstract = {In this work, we evaluated the effect of protein corona formation on graphene oxide (GO) mixture toxicity testing (i.e., co-exposure) using the Daphnia magna model and assessing acute toxicity determined as immobilisation. Cadmium (Cd2+) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were selected as co-pollutant and protein model system, respectively. Albumin corona formation on GO dramatically increased its colloidal stability (ca. 60\%) and Cd2+ adsorption capacity (ca. 4.5 times) in reconstituted water (Daphnia medium). The acute toxicity values (48 h-EC50) observed were 0.18 mg L\&minus;1 for Cd2+-only and 0.29 and 0.61 mg L\&minus;1 following co-exposure of Cd2+ with GO and BSA@GO materials, respectively, at a fixed non-toxic concentration of 1.0 mg L\&minus;1. After coronation of GO with BSA, a reduction in cadmium toxicity of 110 \% and 238\% was achieved when compared to bare GO and Cd2+-only, respectively. Integration of datasets associated with graphene-based materials, heavy metals and mixture toxicity is essential to enable re-use of the data and facilitate nanoinformatics approaches for design of safer nanomaterials for water quality monitoring and remediation technologies. Hence, all data from this work were annotated and integrated into the NanoCommons Knowledge Base, connecting the experimental data to nanoinformatics platforms under the FAIR data principles and making them interoperable with similar datasets.},

It started with an introduction to the Scinote inventory and continues with hands-on instructions on how to manage, modify, create, and import protocols for assays. Tasks can be defined and assigned to different users and/or groups. Finally, data (incl. all relevant metadata) can be exported resulting in reports that facilitate data FAIRness. Technology advancement, the emergence of nanoinformatics and FAIR data principles implementation have increased the need for high-quality datasets. To achieve this, the data produced through academia, industry and regulatory bodies needs to be properly curated, to contain sufficient metadata and to be semantically annotated. In this way, data can be accessible and readable from both humans and machines, making it possible to be queried and mined using appropriate systems. One of the main objectives of NanoCommons is to promote the FAIR data principles, cross-project collaboration and data interoperability. This will make it possible to offer the nanosafety community high quality data that can be combined to produce big datasets and be used in novel modelling, machine learning, deep learning and AI techniques. The University of Birmingham (UoB) aims to achieve this by implementing data management processes covering the entire data lifecycle, and by moving the data curation process to the data generators. Capturing the data and metadata as they are produced will save substantial time and resources, while resulting in higher quality datasets. ELNs can be implemented, through cloud services or locally, into everyday experimental practice streamlining and simplifying experimental and computational workflows, practices and data capturing.

An efficient modelling approach is needed to shorten the development process of materials-enabled products. This Review of Materials Modelling describes modelling of materials, their properties and use in industrial applications illustrated by H2020 LEIT NMBP Materials projects. It does not require prior knowledge of the subject. It is written for anybody interested. It contains no equations. The Review is to provide insight into the work of the modellers and help the reader to see the models as more than mere “black boxes”. This Review of Materials Modelling shows that industry is a very active player both in modelling for production and in modelling research areas. Industry identifies the specifications for material properties and the modelling then finds which material composition can meet the specs and how production can be done. This «Materials by Design» approach has been supported during the last decade in the EU Framework Programmes. Application areas of modelling span all industrial sectors. The bulk of the projects are applying existing models to new materials, which shows that the current state of the art of modelling can be characterised as «mature».},

	abstract = {Nanotechnology is of increasing significance. Curation of nanomaterial data into electronic databases offers opportunities to better understand and predict nanomaterials’ behaviour. This supports innovation in, and regulation of, nanotechnology. It is commonly understood that curated data need to be sufficiently complete and of sufficient quality to serve their intended purpose. However, assessing data completeness and quality is non-trivial in general and is arguably especially difficult in the nanoscience area, given its highly multidisciplinary nature. The current article, part of the Nanomaterial Data Curation Initiative series, addresses how to assess the completeness and quality of (curated) nanomaterial data. In order to address this key challenge, a variety of related issues are discussed: the meaning and importance of data completeness and quality, existing approaches to their assessment and the key challenges associated with evaluating the completeness and quality of curated nanomaterial data. Considerations which are specific to the nanoscience area and lessons which can be learned from other relevant scientific disciplines are considered. Hence, the scope of this discussion ranges from physicochemical characterisation requirements for nanomaterials and interference of nanomaterials with nanotoxicology assays to broader issues such as minimum information checklists, toxicology data quality schemes and computational approaches that facilitate evaluation of the completeness and quality of (curated) data. This discussion is informed by a literature review and a survey of key nanomaterial data curation stakeholders. Finally, drawing upon this discussion, recommendations are presented concerning the central question: how should the completeness and quality of curated nanomaterial data be evaluated?},

	abstract = {This paper describes a novel methodology of data documentation in materials characterization, which has as starting point the creation and usage of any Data Management Plan (DMP) for scientific data in the field of materials science and engineering, followed by the development and exploitation of ontologies for the harnessing of data created through experimental techniques. The case study that is discussed here is nanoindentation, a widely used method for the experimental assessment of mechanical properties on a small scale. The new documentation structure for characterization data (CHADA) is based on the definition of (i) sample, (ii) method, (iii) raw data and (iv) data analysis as the main component of the metadata associated to any characterization experiment. In this way, the relevant information can be stored inside the metadata associated to the experiment. The same methodology can be applicable to a large number of techniques that produce big amount of raw data, while at the same time it can be invaluable tool for big data analysis and for the creation of an open innovation environment, where data can be accessed freely and efficiently. Other fundamental aspects are reviewed in the paper, including the taxonomy and curation of data, the creation of ontology and classification of characterization techniques, the harnessing of data in open innovation environments via database construction along with the retrieval of information via algorithms. The issues of harmonization and standardization of such novel approaches are also critically discussed. Finally, the possible implications for nanomaterial design and the potential industrial impact of the new approach are described and a critical outlook is given.},

Our model is based on pre-calculation of the repetitive contributions to the interaction from molecular segments, which allows us to efficiently scan a multitude of molecules and rank them by their adsorption affinity. The interaction between the biomolecular fragments and the nanomaterial are evaluated using a systematic coarse-graining scheme starting from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The NPs are modelled using a two-layer representation, where the outer layer is parameterized at the atomistic level and the core is treated at the continuum level using Lifshitz theory of dispersion forces. We demonstrate that the scheme reproduces the experimentally observed features of the NP protein coronas. To illustrate the use of the methodology, we compute the adsorption energies for human blood plasma proteins on gold NPs of different sizes as well as the preferred orientation of the molecules upon adsorption. The computed energies can be used for predicting the composition of the NP-protein corona for the corresponding material.},

The immobilization was achieved by a two-step procedure:  generation of reactive N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters from the carboxylic acid groups of 2 in the SAM and coupling of these groups with amines on the protein or ligand. Because this method involves a common reactive intermediate that is easily prepared, it provides a convenient method for attaching ligands to SAMs for studies using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (and, in principle, other bioanalytical methods that use derivatized SAMs on gold, silver, and other surfaces). These SAMs were resistant to nonspecific adsorption of proteins having a wide range of molecular weights and isoelectric points. The pH of the coupling buffer, the concentration of protein, the ionic strength of the solution of protein, and the molecular weight of the protein all influenced the amount of the protein that was immobilized. For the proteins investigated in detailcarbonic anhydrase and lysozymethe highest quantities of immobilized proteins were obtained when using a low ionic strength solution at a value of pH approximately one unit below the isoelectric point (pI) of the protein, at a concentration of ∼0.5 mg mL-1. Comparisons of the kinetic and thermodynamic constants describing binding of carbonic anhydrase and vancomycin to immobilized benzenesulfonamide and N-α-Ac-Lys-d-Ala-d-Ala groups, respectively, on mixed SAMs (by methods described in this paper) and in the carboxymethyl dextran matrix of commercially available substrates yielded (for these systems) essentially indistinguishable values of Kd, koff, and kon.},

	abstract = {Due to their small size, nanoparticles have distinct properties compared with the bulk form of the same materials. These properties are rapidly revolutionizing many areas of medicine and technology. Despite the remarkable speed of development of nanoscience, relatively little is known about the interaction of nanoscale objects with living systems. In a biological fluid, proteins associate with nanoparticles, and the amount and presentation of the proteins on the surface of the particles leads to an in vivo response. Proteins compete for the nanoparticle “surface,” leading to a protein “corona” that largely defines the biological identity of the particle. Thus, knowledge of rates, affinities, and stoichiometries of protein association with, and dissociation from, nanoparticles is important for understanding the nature of the particle surface seen by the functional machinery of cells. Here we develop approaches to study these parameters and apply them to plasma and simple model systems, albumin and fibrinogen. A series of copolymer nanoparticles are used with variation of size and composition (hydrophobicity). We show that isothermal titration calorimetry is suitable for studying the affinity and stoichiometry of protein binding to nanoparticles. We determine the rates of protein association and dissociation using surface plasmon resonance technology with nanoparticles that are thiol-linked to gold, and through size exclusion chromatography of protein–nanoparticle mixtures. This method is less perturbing than centrifugation, and is developed into a systematic methodology to isolate nanoparticle-associated proteins. The kinetic and equilibrium binding properties depend on protein identity as well as particle surface characteristics and size.},

Positively and negatively charged nanoparticles bound a range of proteins whereas neutral nanoparticle bound very little. As little as 25\% neutral polymer on the surface of the charged nanoparticles inhibited protein binding, with only slight change in surface charge. Fibrinogen bound with high affinity to both of the charged nanoparticles. However, binding kinetics and protease digestion suggested that the binding orientation for each nanoparticle was different. Only the negatively charged nanoparticles induced cytokine release from THP-1 cells. While common proteins can bind to different nanoparticles, the biological outcome may not be the same. Consequently, knowledge about the composition of the protein corona is not sufficient to predict biological effects of nanoparticles.},

	abstract = {Effective in silico methods to predict protein corona compositions on engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) could help elucidate the biological outcomes of ENMs in biosystems without the need for conducting lengthy experiments for corona characterization. However, the physicochemical properties of ENMs, used as the descriptors in current modeling methods, are insufficient to represent the complex interactions between ENMs and proteins. Herein, we utilized the fluorescence change (FC) from fluorescamine labeling on a protein, with or without the presence of the ENM, as a novel descriptor of the ENM to build machine learning models for corona formation. FCs were significantly correlated with the abundance of the corresponding proteins in the corona on diverse classes of ENMs, including metal and metal oxides, nanocellulose, and 2D ENMs. Prediction models established by the random forest algorithm using FCs as the ENM descriptors showed better performance than the conventional descriptors, such as ENM size and surface charge, in the prediction of corona formation. Moreover, they were able to predict protein corona formation on ENMs with very heterogeneous properties. We believe this novel descriptor can improve in silico studies of corona formation, leading to a better understanding on the protein adsorption behaviors of diverse ENMs in different biological matrices. Such information is essential for gaining a comprehensive view of how ENMs interact with biological systems in ENM safety and sustainability assessments.},

However, considering the high degree of complexity and multifunctionality of ENMs, computational methods originally developed for regular chemicals cannot always be applied explicitly in nanotoxicology. This book discusses the current state of the art and future needs in the development of computational modeling techniques for nanotoxicology. It focuses on (i) computational chemistry (quantum mechanics, semi-empirical methods, density functional theory, molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics), (ii) nanochemoinformatic methods (quantitative structure–activity relationship modeling, grouping, read-across), and (iii) nanobioinformatic methods (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics). It reviews methods of calculating molecular descriptors sufficient to characterize the structure of nanoparticles, specifies recent trends in the validation of computational methods, and discusses ways to cope with the uncertainty of predictions. In addition, it highlights the status quo and further challenges in the application of computational methods in regulation (e.g., REACH, OECD) and in industry for product development and optimization and the future directions for increasing acceptance of computational modeling for nanotoxicology.},

	abstract = {The number and variety of engineered nanoparticles have been growing exponentially. Since the experimental evaluation of nanoparticles causing public health concerns is expensive and time consuming, efficient computational tools are amongst the most suitable approaches to identifying potential negative impacts, to the human health and the environment, of new nanomaterials before their production. However, developing computational models complimentary to experiments is impossible without incorporating consistent and high quality experimental data. Although there are limited available data in the literature, one may apply read-across techniques that seem to be an attractive and pragmatic alternative way of predicting missing physico-chemical or toxicological data. Unfortunately, the existing methods of read-across are strongly dependent on the expert's knowledge. In consequence, the results of estimations may vary dependently on personal experience of expert conducting the study and as such cannot guarantee the reproducibility of their results. Therefore, it is essential to develop novel read-across algorithm(s) that will provide reliable predictions of the missing data without the need to for additional experiments. We proposed a novel quantitative read-across approach for nanomaterials (Nano-QRA) that addresses and overcomes a basic limitation of existing methods. It is based on: one-point-slope, two-point formula, or the equation of a plane passing through three points. The proposed Nano-QRA approach is a simple and effective algorithm for filling data gaps in quantitative manner providing reliable predictions of the missing data.},

	abstract = {Physicochemical properties of chemicals affect their exposure, toxicokinetics/fate and hazard, and for nanomaterials, the variation of these properties results in a wide variety of materials with potentially different risks. To limit the amount of testing for risk assessment, the information gathering process for nanomaterials needs to be efficient. At the same time, sufficient information to assess the safety of human health and the environment should be available for each nanomaterial. Grouping and read-across approaches can be utilised to meet these goals. This article presents different possible applications of grouping and  read-across for nanomaterials within the broader perspective of the MARINA Risk Assessment Strategy (RAS), as developed in the EU FP7 project MARINA. Firstly, nanomaterials can be grouped based on limited variation in physicochemical properties to subsequently design an efficient testing strategy that covers the entire group. Secondly, knowledge about exposure, toxicokinetics/fate or hazard, for example via properties such as dissolution rate, aspect ratio, chemical (non-)activity, can be used to organise similar materials in generic groups to frame issues that need further attention, or potentially to read-across. Thirdly, when data related to specific endpoints is required, read-across can be considered, using data from a source material for the target nanomaterial. Read-across could be based on a scientifically sound justification that exposure, distribution to the target (fate/toxicokinetics) and hazard of the target material are similar to, or less than, the source material. These grouping and read-across approaches pave the way for better use of available information on nanomaterials and are flexible enough to allow future adaptations related to scientific developments.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of manufactured nanomaterials (NMs) are being used in industrial products and need to be registered under the REACH legislation. The hazard characterisation of all these forms is not only technically challenging but resource and time demanding. The use of non-testing strategies like read-across is deemed essential to assure the assessment of all NMs in due time and at lower cost. The fact that read-across is based on the structural similarity of substances represents an additional difficulty for NMs as in general their structure is not unequivocally defined. In such a scenario, the identification of physicochemical properties affecting the hazard potential of NMs is crucial to define a grouping hypothesis and predict the toxicological hazards of similar NMs. In order to promote the read-across of NMs, ECHA has recently published “Recommendations for nanomaterials applicable to the guidance on QSARs and Grouping”, but no practical examples were provided in the document. Due to the lack of publicly available data and the inherent difficulties of reading-across NMs, only a few examples of read-across of NMs can be found in the literature. This manuscript presents the first case study of the practical process of grouping and read-across of NMs following the workflow proposed by ECHA.},

	abstract = {Category formation, grouping and read across methods are broadly applicable in toxicological assessments and may be used to fill data gaps for chemical safety assessment and regulatory decisions. In order to facilitate a transparent and systematic approach to aid regulatory acceptance, a strategy to evaluate chemical category membership, to support the use of read-across predictions that may be used to fill data gaps for regulatory decisions is proposed. There are two major aspects of any read-across exercise, namely assessing similarity and uncertainty. While there can be an over-arching rationale for grouping organic substances based on molecular structure and chemical properties, these similarities alone are generally not sufficient to justify a read-across prediction. Further scientific justification is normally required to justify the chemical grouping, typically including considerations of bioavailability, metabolism and biological/mechanistic plausibility. Sources of uncertainty include a variety of elements which are typically divided into two main issues: the uncertainty associated firstly with the similarity justification and secondly the completeness of the read-across argument. This article focuses on chronic toxicity, whilst acknowledging the approaches are applicable to all endpoints. Templates, developed from work to prepare for the application of new toxicological data to read-across assessment, are presented. These templates act as proposals to assist in assessing similarity in the context of chemistry, toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics as well as to guide the systematic characterisation of uncertainty both in the context of the similarity rationale, the read across data and overall approach and conclusion. Lastly, a workflow for reporting a read-across prediction is suggested.},

Exposure of workers to MNM is of concern, because still much is unknown about health effects. MNM may have different properties, testing of each material is time consuming and costly. Experts have proposed various approaches to categorize MNM to facilitate risk assessment of human health effects based on shared properties of various materials. A systematic literature survey was undertaken to identify expert opinions on grouping of MNM published between the years 2000 and 2015. We summarized and synthesized the opinions according to a systematic review of text and opinion. We identified 22 articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria reporting 17 proposals with three proposals for groups and 14 proposals for criteria for grouping. Five proposals suggested one or more of the following groups of concern: fibrous, biopersistent, high solubility with high toxicity, chemically active. Criteria proposed in multiple studies were: viable testing options, mode of action, physicochemical properties predicting toxicity. We conclude that a limited number of groups have been proposed to categorize MNM according to human health concern. Further research should be conducted to underpin the proposed groups with empirical evidence.},

	abstract = {Given the almost limitless variety of nanomaterials, it will be virtually impossible to assess the possible occupational health hazard of each nanomaterial individually. The development of science-based hazard and risk categories for nanomaterials is needed for decision-making about exposure control practices in the workplace. A possible strategy would be to select representative (benchmark) materials from various mode of action (MOA) classes, evaluate the hazard and develop risk estimates, and then apply a systematic comparison of new nanomaterials with the benchmark materials in the same MOA class. Poorly soluble particles are used here as an example to illustrate quantitative risk assessment methods for possible benchmark particles and occupational exposure control groups, given mode of action and relative toxicity. Linking such benchmark particles to specific exposure control bands would facilitate the translation of health hazard and quantitative risk information to the development of effective exposure control practices in the workplace. A key challenge is obtaining sufficient dose–response data, based on standard testing, to systematically evaluate the nanomaterials’ physical–chemical factors influencing their biological activity. Categorization processes involve both science-based analyses and default assumptions in the absence of substance-specific information. Utilizing data and information from related materials may facilitate initial determinations of exposure control systems for nanomaterials.},

	abstract = {With current progress in science, there is growing interest in developing and applying Physiologically Based Kinetic (PBK) models in chemical risk assessment, as knowledge of internal exposure to chemicals is critical to understanding potential effects in vivo. In particular, a new generation of PBK models is being developed in which the model parameters are derived from in silico and in vitro methods. To increase the acceptance and use of these “Next Generation PBK models”, there is a need to demonstrate their validity. However, this is challenging in the case of data-poor chemicals that are lacking in kinetic data and for which predictive capacity cannot, therefore, be assessed. The aim of this work is to lay down the fundamental steps in using a read across framework to inform modellers and risk assessors on how to develop, or evaluate, PBK models for chemicals without in vivo kinetic data. The application of a PBK model that takes into account the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion characteristics of the chemical reduces the uncertainties in the biokinetics and biotransformation of the chemical of interest. A strategic flow-charting application, proposed herein, allows users to identify the minimum information to perform a read-across from a data-rich chemical to its data-poor analogue(s). The workflow analysis is illustrated by means of a real case study using the alkenylbenzene class of chemicals, showing the reliability and potential of this approach. It was demonstrated that a consistent quantitative relationship between model simulations could be achieved using models for estragole and safrole (source chemicals) when applied to methyleugenol (target chemical). When the PBK model code for the source chemicals was adapted to utilise input values relevant to the target chemical, simulation was consistent between the models. The resulting PBK model for methyleugenol was further evaluated by comparing the results to an existing, published model for methyleugenol, providing further evidence that the approach was successful. This can be considered as a “read-across” approach, enabling a valid PBK model to be derived to aid the assessment of a data poor chemical.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of the quality of data and their use in hazard and risk assessment as a systematic approach is described. Definitions are proposed for reliability, relevance, and adequancy of data. Reliability is differentiated into four categories. Criteria relating to international testing standards for categorizing reliability are developed. A systematic documentation of evaluating reliability especially for use in the IUCLID database is proposed. This approach is intended to harmonize data evaluation processes worldwide. It may help the expert in subsequent assessments and should increase the clarity of evaluation.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of the reliability of toxicological data is of key importance for regulatory decision-making. In particular, the new EU Regulations concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH) and classification, labelling and packaging (CLP) according to the new globally harmonised system (GHS) rely on the integration of all available toxicological information. The so-called Klimisch categories, although well established and widely used, lack detailed criteria for assigning data quality to categories. A software-based tool (ToxRTool) was developed within the context of a project funded by the European Commission to provide comprehensive criteria and guidance for reliability evaluations of toxicological data. It is applicable to various types of experimental data, endpoints and studies (study reports, peer-reviewed publications) and leads to the assignment to Klimisch categories 1, 2 or 3. The tool aims to increase transparency and to harmonise approaches of reliability assessment. The tool consists of two parts, one to evaluate in vivo and one to evaluate in vitro data. The prototypes of the tool were tested in two independent inter-rater experiments. This approach allowed the analysis of the performance of the tool in practice and the identification and minimisation of sources of heterogeneity in evaluation results. The final version, ToxRTool, is publicly available for testing and use.},

	abstract = {The European Union FP-7 project GUIDEnano developed a web-based guidance tool, which guides users to assess human and environmental risks of nanomaterial-enabled products throughout their life cycle. One of the aims in the GUIDEnano hazard assessment strategy is to derive safety limit values based on existing human toxicity and ecotoxicological studies. Clear criteria needed to be established to select studies that could be used for such purpose. In the present paper, we present an approach for a systematical and quantitative evaluation of the quality of environmental and human toxicity studies performed with nanomaterials. The approach builds upon previous initiatives and includes refinements to facilitate its application by users with limited toxicological expertise. It covers in vivo and in vitro human toxicity studies as well as ecotoxicological studies addressing the toxicity to all environmental compartments. A scoring system related to test design and reporting considerations was developed following the principles of the Klimisch score (K score). In addition, the approach includes a scoring system based on the physicochemical properties that have been characterized and reported for the nanomaterial, including properties characterized in the exposure medium (S score). These two scores (K and S) are combined to obtain an overall quality score (Q score) that can be used to select studies, to weight different studies, and/or to introduce uncertainty factors in the risk assessment process. During its development, the approach has been tested and refined with 137 peer-reviewed articles. The final quality assessment approach and the results of its evaluation are presented here.},

	abstract = {Studying the interactions between nanoengineered materials and biological systems plays a vital role in the development of biological applications of nanotechnology and the improvement of our fundamental understanding of the bio–nano interface. A significant barrier to progress in this multidisciplinary area is the variability of published literature with regards to characterizations performed and experimental details reported. Here, we suggest a ‘minimum information standard’ for experimental literature investigating bio–nano interactions. This standard consists of specific components to be reported, divided into three categories: material characterization, biological characterization and details of experimental protocols. Our intention is for these proposed standards to improve reproducibility, increase quantitative comparisons of bio–nano materials, and facilitate meta analyses and in silico modelling.},
